# Kernel module 3 (Take Back the Web)

- **Intention**
- **Freedom**
- **Remember**
- **The present time**
- **Lock the Web open**
- **The search for a new humility**

We have seen that we might alter the incentive structures of society using global, borderless, ownerless protocols for money.

Next: How to free the shared record and ourselves from closed, rent-seeking corporations and an extractive attention economy.

To do this, we need to understand our intentions.

*What kind of reality do you want, and what kinds of freedom are worth speaking into being?*

Three pillars of taking back the web: Augmenting our ability to think, reclaiming our time, and extending our ability to cooperate

—

## Intention

In web3 we can encode our intentions.  
The code then lives independently of us on a shared, global network where it will not change.

There is something ambiguous in each of us. This is wonderful.  
However, **a deployed smart contract remains on mainnet forever**. No bribe or threat can change this.  
I cannot take it back, even if my life depends on it.

> Wouldn’t you prefer to be able to withdraw the code in that case? 
> 
> What happens to our ability to discretely change our ways when we grow wiser? 
> 
> Will web3 disincentivize changing direction because people are held to their previous mistakes and have no way out of the cognitive dissonance? 
> 
> Forgetting can be a blessing; what happens when it is no longer an option?

Honesty about who you intend to be is the most direct path to experiencing a deeper sense of ‘self’: The essence that you share with all life.  
From there we can create technologies that work with us.

[Nicky Case, Evolution - not revolution](https://blog.ncase.me/evolution-not-revolution/)

- Use what’s already there
- All parts evolve together
- Go slow and steady

# Freedom

Freedom is **acceptance of the constraints within which you live** (facing them squarely).  
Buddhists call it the freedom of no escape. Submitting to reality is the beginning of liberation.

Freedom will not be found in an idealized future where we all enjoy sovereignty, universal suffrage, UBI, etc.  
These are necessary, but they will not set us free.

Illich: Only a **sense of enoughness** can stop monopolistic institutions from appropriating all of Earth’s resources, including our identities, in their constant quest for growth.

Value comes from trust in shared truths, and modern trust emerges from protocols that define and encode cheating so it may be prevented. 

**Freedom is our ability to decide which shared truths to trust.** -> We have (some) freedom to define our boundaries, but we can’t operate efficiently without boundaries.

**Lived freedom is conscious navigation of responsibility.**

Products should communicate clearly, how they constrain users.  
This empowers people to become aware of the trade-offs they themselves are making.

Historical precedents: One of the root documents of the free software movement is [the GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html), written by Richard Stallman in 1985.

- If I like a program I must share it with others who like it.
- “I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free.”

## Remember

*Augmenting our ability to think freely for ourselves.*

"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think."

The internet came with grand dreams, but we're stuck with artificial social spaces and extractive incentives that are mining our attention to prop up a failing economy.

Since 1945, one critical idea has been constructing new media for free and creative thought.

V. Bush: The amount of published data surpasses our present ability to make real use of the record. 

Memory systems?

Emotional connection to a subject is the foundation of effective long-term learning.

Language is our primary tool for thought. What will new tools for thought look like? 

This is part of what it means to "take back the web": Building **public tools for thought**, with which we can explore together the edges of our shared record of knowledge, adding new pieces as scaffolding for those who follow.

## The present time

*Reclaiming our time.*

[D. Rushkoff, Present Shock, Team Human](https://youtu.be/_lW0nyKDklI)

Kairos (the "right", opportune time) and Chronos (regulated clock-time).

In the extractive perspective of corporate capitalism, human attention is a commodity, an untapped resource.

Instead of a technology that would wait for us to think and be ready to deal with it, we have ended up in a state of constant emergency interruption.

The blokchain could be our chance to build asynchronous experiences and train people to work/create in their own time?

Our best defense against ‘present shock’ is to be genuinely present.  
This requires us to make eye contact, learn to breathe together.  
Human environments empower us against abstract entities that depend on our isolation and alienation.

13th Century economic OS: Emerging, peer-to-peer economic landscape.  
People developing local currencies and trading in local bazars > new middle class.  
Feudal lords had no part in the wealth creation, so they made it illegal.  
*Crafts > jobs. Paid for results > paid per work hour. A major temporal shift*.  
The invention of the clock and a specific kind of sovereign currency are co-incidental, not coincidence.

The old Greeks saw the future as being behind us - because we can’t see it!

Rushkoff: Optimize our technology for our growing sense of humanity rather than surrender what’s left of our humanity to our growing sense of the technological.

**New economic systems could free us from industrial-age clocks** and let us adopt a different temporal landscape.

Rushkoff: Technologists who disrupt any industry often go right back to Goldman and ask for a Series B.  
They're not willing to undermine the operating system that they're sitting on top of.

*“We don't really need everybody making money, because we don't really need to get to full employment, because we don’t all really need jobs, because we have more than enough stuff already."*

> I don't want a job - I want my needs fulfilled and some basic comfort and security that allows me to contribute meaningfully.

**Time is not money. Time is time.**

Two kids with a laptop can create an app that changes the world.  
But how to help them see that the goal is not to sell it to people who use it against its original purposes?  
It may be enough to have a business which 'just' supports its employees/users!

**The more technology can help us create time to be with others, face to face, the less money needs to be part of the equation.**

What if we used open protocols for money to ensure that no-one ever needs money again? > **Redefinition of wealth.**

Illich: The way ahead will be found by those who are unwilling to be constrained by the apparently all-determining forces and structures of the industrial age.

## Lock the Web open

*Extending our ability to cooperate.*

[Brewster Kahle, Locking the web open](https://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/)

[Juan Benet, What exactly is Web3?](https://youtu.be/l44z35vabvA)

‘Web 3’ is movement across the internet, aimed at **re-imagining how we share and relate**.  
It forms the third pillar of taking back the web - cooperation baked into the protocols we use for collecting, storing, and consulting the shared record that V. Bush spoke of.

B. Kahle appeals to us to **make the web distributed like the internet (protocols, not platforms)**.  
This already happened with e.g. bitcoin.

Distributed architectures naturally lend themselves to more **privacy**.  
Moreover, they have necessitated advancements in **content-addressability** and **peer-to-peer discovery protocols**.  
These will enable **rich memory and versioning systems** so the record of human knowledge becomes less fragile.

Also, distributed systems lend themselves well to local culture and genuinely civic spaces.  
Brewster talks about **a globe of villages, not a global village**: We want everyone to be able to connect to whom they please, but we do not want to cultivate monocultures - diversity is the natural response to adversity.

Web1: Read-only (static)
Web2: Read + write (interactive)
Web3: Read + write + trust (verifiable)

Web1 linked content.  
Web2 links programs to that content and supports rich, dynamic applications that work across devices.  
DWeb links content and programs directly, **removing intermediaries** and adding **public verifiability.**

Broken advertising model in Web2!  
It optimizes for time spent on pages, trying to keep people and their data locked in.  
Anger generates clicks; we're increasingly optimizing for negative emotions.

Blockchains did not start on the web - Bitcoin can run without a browser.  
A big part of Web 3 work is to make blockchains accessible to people.

The decentralized web allows for open services and market protocols.

Smart contracts are computable law.  
If you want to **bake rights into your systems** and ‘lock the web open’, then think about what it means to encode rules into the internet.

Many have talked about the internet becoming a kind of nation, perhaps even a network state. Beware!

*Encoding rules into the jurisdiction of the internet should be about collaboration and agency, opt-in law, mutual aid, reciprocity and care. Trust spaces built upon trustless protocols. Diversity and plurality.*

## The search for a new humility

[Václav Havel, Radical Renewal of Human Responsibility](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/18/vaclav-havel-harvard-commencement/)

The word *humility* comes from the Latin *humilis*, meaning 'on the ground' and *humus*, meaning 'earth'.  
It is the top layer of earth where living matter decays, producing nutrients to birth new life.

Humility means to see others as no different from yourself.  
We all share the same soil; we are all nourished and sustained by what is held in common.

> Not sure I agree with this. True contact requires connectedness *and* difference. 
> 
> Confluence can be deeply problematic.

The source of life in me is the same as in every other being.  
Living this, I do not seek superficial humility, making myself seem small and lowly: I participate whole-heartedly, branching up and out so I can cycle more nutrients through shared roots.

*The main task is a radical renewal of our sense of responsibility. Our conscience must catch up to our reason.*
