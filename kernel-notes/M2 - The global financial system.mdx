## Asking better questions

A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world. Practice **beginner’s mind**, even as you aim for deep appreciation of context.

**Close listening** and **clear attention** are preconditions for good questions.

**Accepting your own limitations** and inability to understand everything creates the space within for curiosity.

When the Stranger says:  
"What is the meaning of this city? Do you huddle close together because you love each other?"  
What will you answer?

## Money and speech

[Open Money Manifesto](https://openmoney.org/top/omanifesto.html)

Web3 allows us to *make* money. We must speak it into existence with integrity.

Open money is sufficient and free. It is issued by us, as promises to redeem. It continually re-circulates.

‘Free speech’? Well… Everyone is allowed to speak and the cost of meaningful (i.e. state-changing) speech is well-defined. 

Speaking is doing. Malicious behaviors are made prohibitively expensive. 

**Incentives: The costs for the speaker should always be more than those imposed on the listeners.**

## Recollecting our origins

[Nick Szabo, The origins of money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)

Money as a language helps us solve problems of cooperation when trust is low.

This lets us overcome **the value measurement problem** - how to remember who owes what in case of delayed reciprocity and when trading back scratches for fruit?

With money we only need n prices for n products. Not n(n-1) for all combinations.

Money works as a **medium of exchange** or as a **standard of value** – as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large or change too often.

Money itself has a price! Different prices for different kinds of money.

Early money, e.g. shells, may be seen as **collectibles**. Both parties gain something.

Communicating and transferring value is the same, but media that are not perfect abstractions - which have intrinsic value - obfuscate this.

Low transaction costs require **closed loops of mutually beneficial trades**: Collectibles keep circulating, amortizing their costs.

Collectibles may act as a container for **memory across generations**.  
For example, they may represent the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.

Money contains the memories of our indebtedness to each other.

Evolution: Collectibles > coins.

Why was minting dominated by governments, not private interests? It may have to do with the government's ability to enforce effective anti-counterfeit measures, but also with the fact that coins as high-velocity money facilitate a large number of low value trades. - The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure the value of his subjects’ wealth accurately.

Can we have efficient marketplaces without central authorities so the positive side effects of global trade can accrue to the people trading, rather than the authorities allowing that trade to occur?

## Debt - The first 5000 years

[David Graeber on Debt](https://youtu.be/CZIINXhGDcs)

Different perspective on the development of money. 

**Debt, guilt, and sin** are the same word in Sanskrit. Life itself is a cosmic debt we owe to the gods. But the Vedas also say that you are the cosmos, and so there can be no such thing as debt.

The same happens in the Bible. The Arameic word for debt and sin is the same. 

> Forlad os vor skyld, som også vi forlade vores skyldnere.

What is sacred is forgiveness of debts.

Debt is **key to relationships** in many old traditions: Someone gives something and expects something in return, but not something of exactly the same value as that would indicate you no longer wish to relate with them. Ideally, everybody is a little in debt to everyone.

97% of all transactions in England up until the 17th Century were by credit. Every now and then they held communal reckonings to cancel the debt they could, and pay back the amounts still outstanding. 

Nice people operate on credit and trust.

A debt is a promise that you can phrase in exactly quantifiable terms. Therefore it's impersonal, i.e. transferable. According to some theories, **money is a transferable promise**.

How does a ranking system like ‘a cow is roughly like a canoe is roughly like a good necklace’ turn into a system with exact proportional equivalence? When someone is angry! Between friends there's no need to calculate, but even where you don't have markets for goods, you often have elaborate fines for personal damages.

Virtual money is the original form of money. Physical money was mainly invented to pay soldiers. 

With virtual money, a mechanism to protect debtors is needed, like periodic debt cancellation, or anti-usury laws and profit-sharing. **The idea that nobody should ever default is absurd**; in such a system, the distinction between slavery, and being so in debt that you sell yourself or your time every day is just legalistic.

*Between equals, debt is just a broad moral feeling that you should come through. The philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality.*

## Banking in the shadows

> This chapter of the syllabus is very hard for me to understand.

**Liquidity vs. solvency.**

By law, banks must be solvent, hence the focus of traditional economics. However, liquidity is what really drives all the action.

There are **different prices of money**. 

- Interest rate (future)
- Par (now) (faktisk værdi = pålydende)
- Exchange rate (foreign)
- Price level (commodities)

Knowing this can help us appreciate what it means to have a payment system which no-one controls, as ultimately liquidity constraints will define the kinds of programmable money that are useful.



The critical point here is that the beating heart, and the tension between **elasticity and discipline**, is currently managed by a group of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed. This is neither good nor bad; it’s a fact.

Why it [may not be optimal](https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-World/dp/0143116800)

With programmable money we can code financial systems to be responsive in new ways. We can program stability in ways previously unimaginable. But, we must understand how hard that is, why, and what the trade-offs have been throughout history. 

This is not about destroying central banks - they are useful. It is about changing the kind of money that sits on top of the pyramid from Federal Reserve notes to an ownerless, borderless, global, peer-to-peer ledger which holds us all equally accountable. 

It is about changing the ways in which financial organizations can respond to the needs of a global and interconnected system, and removing the possibility of corruption and manipulation as much as possible with the technology we have.

## Engineering money

[The killer app (A. Antonopoulos)](https://youtu.be/MxIrc1rxhyI)

Money is the killer app. It is foundational for all commerce so it touches everything. 

*To do the neutral, open, decentralized commerce, trade, identity, land registry etc. you need money that is open, borderless, decentralized, censorship-resistant and global.*

If you're not altering the incentive structure on which your society runs, just use a database.

Three critical features of good money:

- Store of value (SOV)
- Medium of exchange (MOE)
- Unit of account (UOA)

It’s always a trade-off; we must consider scarcity, portability, durability, fungibility, divisibility, acceptability and stability. 

But now we can engineer money with the characteristics we choose!

We can engineer abstract monetary protocols to change gradually higher-order social contracts.

We can also invent features of money that have never existed before. E.g., our money is now a **universal ledger of transactions**. A trackable, auditable ledger that can tell us where money has been and what it was used for. Or we can tweak the **privacy** dial and say individuals should have privacy and governments should be accountable.

It is easy to move from one crypto to another. Instead of trade-offs, we just trade. I can disaggregate the fundamental properties of money, on demand: even better, my wallet can do it for me.

We can create any number of new features with perfectly abstract money. However, *what engineering money is really about is changing the control architecture which informs its creation and distribution.*

Kernel suggests that we consider at least one more critical feature. Can we engineer **money as a measure of care?**

Can we create a culture where I am wealthy by virtue of what I care for, rather than what I control? Where wealth means “having enough to share” because who you are is already enough. Can we create environments where what I hold is made valuable because of the community to which it binds me?
