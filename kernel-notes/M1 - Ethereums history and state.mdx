## Meaning

[Good copy, bad copy](https://youtu.be/ByY6j0qzOyM)

A **fight for liberty** - not conducted with political rhetorics, but hashed out in technical protocols.

Cryptography may secure our ability to speak freely, without the need to trust corruptible institutions.

Knowing a computation was verifiably done is like inventing religion for programs.  
With verifiable protocols, a program will know the minds (state and processing capability) of other programs.  
There’s no longer this idea of servers of data.

> Inventing religion - or killing the gods? Knowing is not faith...

So, what does Ethereum *mean*? The answers are to be found on block explorers...

> Doesn’t *meaning* signify something very different for humans than for machines? 
> 
> I think human meaning is best expressed in human languages *because* they are ambiguous!

Aether: “Pure, fresh air” or "clear sky". (Heaven above the clouds)

B. Fuller: “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”

E.E. Cummings: “To know is to possess, and any fact is possessed by everyone who knows it, whereas those who feel truth are possessed, not possessors."

> But also Grundtvig: "He has never lived / who came to truly know / that which he did not love first."

## Value

Claim: Trust in **clearly shared truths** lies at the core of how we might generate valuable interactions between people.

> I think disagreement can be very valuable. 
> 
> Fear keeps us live. Confluence is dangerous. Group think is a real risk. 
> 
> But of course maths is true for everyone.

How to create shared truth? Through **fiction - the lie that reveals truth**.

History: 

&emsp;Tribal narratives >  
&emsp;Religious myths and writen records (central authority) >  
&emsp;Legal fiction (backed by threat of violence) >  
&emsp;Blockchain (a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction)

How many people can reliably share the truth your fiction reveals?

> Is bigger/more always better? When is it better?

## Playdough Protocols

History of seals. Unforgeable identities. Data integrity. Censorship resistance. 

Money is a token of faith, and Blockchain matters beyond money.

The stories you tell yourself about yourself rest beneath everything you will learn about trust, money, speech, freedom etc.

Modern tamper evidence: cryptography provides one-way hash functions (‘checksums’) and digital signatures

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the next block in a timeless story about the evolution of trust and its effect on what it means to be human.

## The ideas behind Ethereum

[Vitalik - Understanding the Ethereum Protocol](https://youtu.be/gjwr-7PgpN8)

Calculator (Bitcoin) vs smartphone (Ethereum).

Features of Ethereum:

- Built-in Turing-complete language
- People can put scripts into transactions and send them to the blockchain > Account at that address.
- Contractual accounts and Externally Owned Accounts: Same privileges.
- Anyone can create an application, and anyone can interact with it.

Gas: Fee for every computational step the VM must take. Limited max. steps per block.

Ethereum’s state: Mapping of addresses > account objects.

The critical point is the notion of a general purpose OS - **one big VM distributed across the world, shared by everyone, owned by no-one**.  
It can't be turned off without also turning off the internet.

Your 12 or 24-word mnemonic could lead to your entire OS, accessible from anywhere. The world becomes an infinitely programmable playground.

Ethereum Foundation values: **Kaizen** (continuous improvement) + Principle of Subtraction (growing small).  
Consistently subtract from your own importance and influence > continuous improvement in the community's capacity and capability.  
Don’t shirk responsibility!

## Ethereal Dreamers

[Poem - The Layers](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54897/the-layers)

Ethereum founders: Motivated not by money but passion for the idea of a free, open and decentralized world.

Claim: **Ethereum is the internet’s government, and smart contracts are its laws.**

Laws can be formal/substantial, global/opt-in

> Or moral?
> 
> If they are opt-in, are they *really* opt-in?

Ethereum: Learn the language, write the laws.  
The network deterministically enforces agreed upon costs for speech.

Good laws provide clear advantages to followers and allow cooperation & trust.

> What about out-group populations? Majority dictatorships? Group pressure?

Low cost opt-in laws that cannot be broken allows us to **apply trial and error to governance**.  
Everyone may scrutinize such a law.

Code is law: Libertarian attempt to reduce costs & uncertainty of human language?  
Dystopian replacement of safeguards and rights with binary logic? See [Myers](https://robmyers.org/2014/05/09/artworld-ethereum-identity-ownership-and-authenticity/), [Becker](https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/katrin-becker-on-lex-cryptographia/)

Unprecedented **arena for cooperative games**. (V. Griffith)

When we warp non-cooperative games into coalitional ones, the rational choice becomes cooperation.  
Ethereum could, in theory, make any game cooperative. 

Example: Climate-change. Make it more profitable to protect commons as they becomes more abused. (S. de la Rouviere)

> Is that the best way to go? 
> 
> Health issues make it profitable to be a therapist. Wouldn’t it be better to make us superfluous?  
> Is there any reason to believe that the incentives don’t corrupt?

Games can also be warped coercively!  
Suggested remedy: **Radically open knowledge, sharing and communication**.

Low barriers for small, incentivized contributions can produce grand, stigmergic emergence.

The consequences of game warping are difficult to predict and understand!

When building mechanisms with high-stakes outcomes, they must be **credibly neutral**.

- Don’t write specific people or outcomes into the mechanism
- Open source, publicly verifiable rules
- Keep it simple
- Don’t change it too often

Books are proof that humanity is capable of magic. > Time travel. (C. Sagan)

**Think not of yourself, but of seven generations from now**.

## Life is a work of art

[Mari Li: Joyful Subversion](https://youtu.be/Aalyplbv5Mo)

Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks to tick off or a constantly climbing graph, maybe think of it as a canvas to fill with weird artwork?

**In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.** 

In a fearful society, love and trust are primary tools of resistance.

5 ways of **joyfully subverting status quo**:

- Do small things
- Experiment with format
- Create (and hold) space
- Mind symbolism
- Build on history
