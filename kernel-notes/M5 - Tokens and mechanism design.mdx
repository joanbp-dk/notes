**Token**: Object, word or sequence to authenticate knowledge or possession. Grants the holder certain privileges.

Tokens on Ethereum are facts about key-value mappings in shared contracts, with a visible historical trail of all values associated with any key.

‘Token’ is related to ‘teach’. Web3 tokens can be used to teach by creating incentives for certain behaviours.

## Incentives

**Incentive**: From Latin *incantare*, to chant or charm. The adjective *incentivus* means 'setting the tune'.

Incentives set our shared tunes. They are the unseen flows that shape our collective behaviour.  
If the tune is harmonious, that's wonderful, but history holds many examples of perverse incentives.

By making the incentives of our code public and verifiable, we can co-create persuasively wholesome structures.

What constitutes persuasive language? Words that perform what they say.

> Parallel: The most persuasive people are those who live their own teachings.

How can we know what behaviour we should incentivize?

You can’t predict the second and third order effects of your code.  
You can be deeply aware that such effects exist, and use this to inform your intention.

Incentives are **not only about rewards**. That is just how they are often programmed; maybe because rewards are easy to market to the masses.  
Also, tokens are **only scarce if we design them so**.  
Knowing this, we can think more creatively about balanced, collective incentive structures to keep public goods both good and public.  
This leads us into software as service.

## Listening and stories

Valuable speech requires listeners. The quality of listening informs the quality of talking.  
When I listen, I require you to pay attention to what you're saying.

Good listeners may listen *as a response*.

Modern culture treats conversation as competition, but listening cultivates **horizontal conversations**.  
I can enjoy being interrupted - we may return to the topic later without context loss.  
We seek shared exploration, not just our own opinions.  
We can lay different threads and return repeatedly to follow each one, without stress or fear that our relationship might fall apart any moment.

Like gardeners, we listen to one another's fictions, consider their implications, and use concensus-mechanisms to seek fertile directions in which to grow the conversation.

Who we listen to, and how we listen, informs our society’s incentive structures.  
**Censorship resistant tools** may help us ensure that anybody can be listened to.

By listening deeply we develop the art of attention, leading to better questions.  
By being available for others we learn how to listen to our heart and become aware of our own intentions.

The infinite game unfolds on some ground, even if the map is revealed dynamically as we explore together. This ground is **silence**.

Silence is an open commons that must be cared for.  
Otherwise, we begin to see the endless emptiness within as just another resource to be used to gain yet another conceptual label.

Practice listening. Then the stories you choose to tell - to yourself and others - will become more illuminating.

*Listening in silence, I disappear.*

## What is Amazon?

*Before writing effective economic code, we must know successful mechanisms of the past so we can mimic the best and improve the worst.  
By observing the interplay of algorithms, platforms and incentives, we can think about how to program sustainable societies.*

Walmart and Amazon as an example:

Walmart optimized selection, pricing, and inventory of goods in a local store.

Jeff Bezos’ realization (1994): The advent of the internet and online shopping meant *infinite shelf space* for online retailers.

What is the next ordinary parameter which will be blown away by networked protocols for value?  
If we can find it, we could write algorithms premised on the idea that wealth means having enough to share...

Amazon's algorithm: Vast selection + fast delivery + minimal prices + guaranteed satisfaction.  
They identified their vendor onboarding process as a bottleneck - and decided to open the Amazon website to third party sellers.

Other issues: Computing power, data storage, developing website features fast enough to exploit all the merchandising opportunities.  
This led to Amazon Web Services, and Bezos decided to expose Amazon’s entire product catalog via an API.

Around 2002, we start to see **a pattern**: 

1) Amazon sees a bottleneck to growth 
2) An internal process or resource is the bottleneck
3) Amazon can’t develop and deploy enough resources to remove the bottleneck, so: 
4) It builds an interface to let the market solve it - and then becomes a customer of its own open platform.

The pattern was repeated with vendor selection (Amazon Marketplace), technology infrastructure (Amazon Web Services), and merchandising (Amazon’s Catalog API).

Bezos’ masterstroke was avoiding the bureaucratic complexity that could have caused Amazon to implode.

Unsolved: How to find the right products? => **Misaligned incentives**:  
Amazon earns big money off ‘sponsored products’, but this means customers are unlikely to be buy the optimal product.  
Amazon's catalog grows, but the number of top slots does not.  
Growing competition puts pressure on the system and incentivizes bad-actor tactics.

Programmable incentives could be key to disrupting Amazon!

## The people’s narrative

Advertising is the most demonised part of web2.  
When revenue accrues to one central party, it is addictive and extractive - the sort of perverse incentives we want to avoid.  

However, advertising could also inform about how to meaningfully participate in communities.  
What makes a model meaningful is its narrative.

> Well... Maybe? At least in a world out of touch with its fundamentals. 

**Epsilon theory**: The smartest is not to invest in the stock with best fundamentals; it's to invest in the stock most people will bet on.  
When we all think this way, it gets very complicated.

Epsilon ~ other people’s behavior. Everyone is thinking in terms of narrative and playing the player.

**The trap of 'common knowledge'**:  
The more people who share a non-common view, the longer it takes to break the narrative, *and the bigger that break will be*.

If we can map the narrative spaces, we can anticipate human behaviour.  
The question is not whether such predictive models are right or wrong; it's whether they are useful.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have no strategy - they are means of ordering transactional facts in time so no-one may own either order or fact.  
We are not fighting the system but abandoning it.  
There is no them-and-us, just a crowd of people looking in the mirror to figure out what the crowd thinks.

Three possible developments:

- Competition between nations leads to adoption of public, decentralized networks
- Such networks become so useful that nation states must adopt them to stay relevant (like TCP/IP) 
- There is a generational narrative shift led by disenfranchised youth.

There is a natural alliance (which could be cemented with the right narratives) between value investors and disenfranchised youth.  
This could shake the current financial system.

Hope arises from linking people from around the world in a community of knowledge.  
It’s ultimately about finding *people who are in this world, but not of it*: Good-hearted, disaffected people, who want liberty and justice for all.

## Revealing the universe

What do computer games have to do with token design?

Mechanism design is about asking the simplest "what if?" question you can, and fully exploring the possibilities.

Great mechanism design revolves around *small nuggets of truth, packaged with minimal contrivance*.  
This allows people to find and experience themselves.

## Prosocial value

How can we research, understand and model behaviour that leads to sustainable societies? 

What would it mean to design games with goals like:

- reducing loneliness
- decreasing toxicity
- boosting positive connections

Online toxicity results from bad social design and weak enforcement of positive social norms.  
When we're lonely and stressed, our desire to belong gets expressed in negative ways like trolling or destroying others' connections.

Economic practices often undervalue psychological and logistical aspects of friendship formation.
Common behavioral models envision *rational, atomic individuals who are good judges of their needs, and who exist within weak social networks*.  
Such models are clearly flawed.

Moreover, most economists assume *a price for everything*.  
This undervalues long term relationships and over-emphasizes short term measurable improvements.

Human groups create relationships, norms and cultural practices.  
These **public goods** are incredibly valuable in terms of health and happiness. But they are not readily measured by economic transactions.  
Social public goods are almost invisible in economic theory.

Problem: Many economic theories are only testable in the world, and the experiments inevitably lack power and scope.  
In this sense, economics is less of a science and more a kind of map-making.  
The discipline has increasingly been pulled into politics, rhetoric and ideology.

There *are* truths in economic systems.  
We can use these to adopt prosocial values in games and economies: Friendship, thriving individuals, altruism, positive norms, shared goals.

By being explicit about our values, we can engineer away from individual and group toxicity, and the loneliness they engender.

**Responsible social systems design** requires an ethical core.  
We are operating on human beings. We should do no harm and aim to improve social health.

> There’s more to this chapter of the syllabus, but I find it difficult to follow. Maybe I'll understand more at a later point.
