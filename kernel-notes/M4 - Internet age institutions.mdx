*Don't break down barriers whose function you don’t understand.*

Extitutional theory: ‘Exclosures’ protect the activity within it from control.

The internet causes shifts in how we **identify ourselves**, how we **reach consensus**, and how we **experience time**. 

Anarchy: No rulers, not no rules. Counterpower is institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation

**Commons and custom**:  
A commons is a space established by custom. A law could never give sufficient details to regulate a commons.  
Commons are not resources; they belong to way of being where it is not production that counts, but physical use according to rules established by custom.

## Govern yourself

The Cypherpunks were mostly anarchists. Belief: If you build tools to let people help themselves, good governance results.

I.e., good tools are not tools for governing; they help us help each other effectively.

Aiming to help others implies a patronizing power dynamic: I have, you lack.

Reciprocal incentive structures make it economically optimal for all to agree.  
If we are able to program incentives and the flow of value, there is no need to vote every four years; we can 'govern' dynamically.

Don't fight the system. Abandon it.  
A-legal systems: You can’t sue a storm or a blockchain. 

*We obviate the need to govern by incentivizing collaborative care required for individual autonomy.*

## Radically

It is not enough to wave our hands and say "emergent communal structure".  
We can use mathematical tools to model optimal collective decision making. 

[Liberal Radicalism](https://gitcoin.co/blog/experiments-with-liberal-radicalism/) describes a funding design deviced by Vitalik Buterin et.al., extending ideas from quadratic voting.

Goal: Create a funding system that is as flexible and responsive as the market, but avoids free-rider problems.

Key idea: If individuals contribute to the public goods they value, we should subsidize small contributions heavily and large ones less (these are more likely private goods).

## Transform the internet

Art helps us question value and meaning.

Art throws a veil over the invisible so its outline may be seen. It requires the encounter with an other. 

Great art transmits what cannot be said, or sung, or heard, or felt.

Technological innovations often result in significant artistic advances in sight, perception, philosophy and culture.

*What new pluralities will networks of and for value allow us to envision?*

## Illegible consensus

Humans want order and meaning. But this is not always the way of the world. Legible routines are hallmarks of authoritarian structure.  
We must find a middle way between the imposition of order and the tyranny of structurelessness. 

### The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) governance: 

Engineering requires trade-offs.  
Minority views must be addressed, with justification.  
The group must honestly consider the objection and fully address all technical issues.  
The key is to separate the unappealing from the truly problematic.

Actual software constraints tend to be few and obvious. Possibilities are vast.  
Primary challenges: Resisting limiting visions, finding fertile direction and allying with the right people.

Conceding when there is an outstanding technical objection is not consensus.  
Even worse is: "If you don’t object to my proposal, I'll not object to yours."

**Rough consensus**: The group has taken any objection seriously AND examined the ramifications AND found that all requirements are still met.

‘Humming’ can be a way to take the room temperature and find a starting place. The aim is to prompt discussion and questions, not skip them.

### DWeb challenge: 

Consensus is ‘called’ by a chair, but such authority has no place in global decentralized systems.  
However, the authority of the chair traditionally empowers individuals to get work done. How are we to handle this?

Proposed solutions often use some kind of distributed and dynamic reputation system.  
But if votes are economic actions, why not have as many working groups as we can fund?  
That way, instead of rough consensus, **things will be decided by actual use**.

*Build systems that help people govern themselves, and let them actually do so.*

## Who are you?

[K. Kreutler: Inventories, not identities](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e).  
[A. Z. Lewis: Being your selves](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/23/being-your-selves-identity-rd-on-alt-twitter/).

Narratives of self-sovereignity miss that identity is (also) relational.  
Current systems construct identity as a proof of exclusive knowledge or possession. But identity is a question!

Characteristics of an **identity architecture relying on reciprocity**:

- Communal/conversational space first.
- Role-playing games (pseudonymity)
- Performative signatures (multi-signatures)

Such approaches make privacy less problematic. They are about how you can respond to other voices in the moment.

> So if I always wear masks, I will be safe? ...

Masks reveal as much as they obscure. They allow you to explore identities. 

Many initiatives have worked on allowing people to grant, revoke, and share partial access to their identifying data (zero-knowledge proofs).  
We could use this to create universal logins. But this still relies on the notion of a ‘profile’, rather than a web of reciprocity.

Web3 wallets are a powerful identity regime. We must think carefully about how we wield them, especially as the distinction between financial and social applications fades.

*Kernel suggests architectures where who you are isn’t the central concern.  
Your identity is just an icon and an evolving collection of items that grant you rights to execute functions and act out roles.*

Such identities can be worn like clothing. Accountable reputation follows them. They can be shared.

**Identity as an inventory** allows one to play roles according to functions. Boundaries need not be static.

We (?) long for identities which enable rather than confine; communicate across rather than cut-off; let us relate in our multitudes, not relegate who we are to one ‘real’ name or account.

## Finding lost paradises

The internet has moved us into a new temporal landscape.  
A few ideologies - that created our shared sense of historical time - have been replaced by **endlessly forking narratives**.

Our grandparents could leave out things and emphasize ‘the good’. **Perfect digital memory** is a blessing *and* a curse.

Was there ever a shared sense of Reality?  
Do we need it to co-exist peacefully, or is it enough to share **non-contextual, transactional interactions**?  

The disruption of Old Time created a void that is being filled by online communities and cults.  
People seek out groups and ideologies that put them 'back in time’.

Bitcoin taught us how to develop decentralized systems that can synchronize our transactional realities.

Are we facing a collective dementia and inability to co-create imaginations of the future?  
Or is a genuinely shared collective imagination emerging? One that is simply foreign and disorientating to minds used to following a ‘Reality’ created by the few?

Digital media has done away with what created our sense of history: imperfect memory.  
But *forgetting may be a feature, not a bug*. It makes us feel like we’re moving forward, rather than running in circles. Our ancestors knew this.  
Artful forgetting, editing, and curation let them craft narratives to help their children understand the past and orient towards the future.  
The internet has undercut time-tested practices of inter-generational knowledge transfer.

We turn to algorithms to sort through our inhumanly perfect memory.  
They have issues, but maybe our ability to imagine collective futures hasn’t been damaged for good.  
And old ghosts can inspire us; last time this much history emerged from hibernation was when the Renaissance was about to begin. 

**The web is a house of mirrors**. This is terrifying and liberating.  
How well you know yourself? We should implement protocols that can’t selectively warp the reflections.

We’re transitioning from a world of linear narratives and time lines to a garden of forking memes.  
The richest environments, deepest stories, and most interesting characters will attract more people.

What to do in a multiverse of different subjective understandings of time?  
Suggestion: Create a garden - somewhere tranquil where you can live at ease; a place that responds naturally to the world around it.

*Old Sufi teaching: "It does not matter if it is the Day of Reckoning; if you have a date palm seed in your hand, plant it!"*
