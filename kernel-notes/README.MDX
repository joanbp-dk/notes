This folder contains my notes pertaining to the [Kernel syllabus](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/).

They have been written with the aim of giving me a way to quickly review those ideas that seem **most important to me**.  
This is of course a highly subjective matter. It is also subject to change, and I may continue to update the notes in the future.

Mostly, I have simply reproduced the syllabus contents, sometimes verbatim, but mostly in a highly shortened form.
In some places I have jotted down **my own thoughts or questions**. I have tried to mark this, using the quotation markdown.

> I wonder how intuitive or useful my style of note taking is for others, but - well, these are my notes, after all.

You may use my notes in any way you see fit, as long as you do so with kindness.  
If you want to quote Kernel on someting, please check what is actually written on the official Kernel website.  
While I intend my notes to be meaningful and fairly loyal to the syllabus, they may for various reasons not always be accurate.
