This folder contains my notes pertaining to the [Kernel syllabus](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/).

They have been written with the aim of giving me a way to quickly review those ideas that seem most important to me.  
This is of course a highly subjective matter.  
It is also subject to change, and so I may continue to update the notes as my understanding of these topics evolve and/or as the Kernel syllabus itself changes.

Mostly, I have simply reproduced the syllabus contents, sometimes verbatim, but mostly in a shortened form.
In some places I have jotted down my own thoughts or questions. I have tried to mark this, using the quotation markdown.

> I wonder how intuitive this is for others, but - well, these are my notes, after all.

Use my notes in any way you see fit, as long as you do it with kindness and care.
