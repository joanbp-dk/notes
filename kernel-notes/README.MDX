This folder contains my notes pertaining to the [Kernel syllabus](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/).

They have been written with the aim of giving me a way to quickly review those ideas that seem **most important to me**.  
This is of course a highly subjective matter, and subject to change. I may update the notes in the future.

Mostly, my note-taking consists of shortening and simplifying the syllabus contents.  
Sometimes I also jot down thoughts or questions of my own. I have tried to mark these by using quotation markdown:

> I wonder how intuitive or useful my style of note taking is for others, but - well, these are my notes, after all.

You may use these notes in any way you like, as long as you do so with kindness.  
If you want to quote Kernel on someting, please check what is actually written on the official Kernel website.  
While I intend my notes to be meaningful and fairly loyal to the syllabus, they may for various reasons not always be accurate.
