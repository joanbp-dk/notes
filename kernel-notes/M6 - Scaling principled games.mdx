## Censorship resistance

[Vitalik on The Problem of Censorship](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/06/the-problem-of-censorship)

Freedom of speech does not imply an ability to communicate *effectively*.  
But **blockchains fuse money (action) and speech (expression)**, and by cultivating a **listening society**, we can substantiate our freedom to speak even further.

Power structures influence what truths can be thought. **Programmable incentives** may help free us from this constraint. 

When the incentives which define the structure of power can be programmed by anyone, censorship resistance becomes an engineering problem, not an ideological one.

> Not everyone can write code; programmers can only define their own code; noone is only affected by his own code - and many parts of life will not take place on the blockchain.
> Thus, there is still a definite need to discuss ideology, and to speak truth to power.
>
> Web3 incentives could become the worst oppressor (and mind killer) of all.

"Don't fight the system. Just abandon it." 

> Well. In some cases, anyway.

Goal: Building clear and complete **threat models** which allow us to understand all possible benefits for potential censors.

Instead of using legal code to uphold free speech, we can use economic code to make censorship prohibitively expensive.  
Even if you have the economic-computational power to revert history, any economic gain is eclipsed by the loss of trust (=value) in the network.

Censorship can be more insidious than overt reversions of history though. 

**Proof of Work**: If you censor a block, you can take its transactions and its block reward for yourself.

Ethereum already provides means of making censorship costly outside the actual consensus mechanism.  
For instance, denial of service attacks are prevented by assigning a "gas" cost to each operation and limiting the amount of gas per block. 

Ethereum 2.0 aims at higher fault tolerance and stronger censorship resistance through more complete threat models and cost analysis.  

**Proof of stake**: Employs game theory along with cryptography to prove that censorship is asymmetrically expensive for the perpetrator.

We'll be using value created on a public network to secure that same network.  
This kind of economic feedback loop will lay the foundation for digital gardens where time flows differently.

## Learning

Learning is not the acquisition of knowledge (wisdom) or the ability to memorize content and pass an assessment (regurgitation).

Learning requires 1) a desire to know, 2) a determination to practice what you know, 3) a passion that will not let you stop until you know, and 4) a heart clear enough to know its own intention for pursuing knowledge in the first place.

To learn, you must let it happen by being aware, and you must be honest enough to follow the secret fire at the core of your being.

Ultimately, learning how to learn is a practice built on a deep trust. You have to trust that you will come to know what you need to know when you need to know it. This trust creates the necessary conditions for useful knowledge to take root.

The rest is practice. Practice, practice, practice - until you realise that there is no difference between practice and perfection. That what you most wanted to know was here all along, right with you, and all that work and struggle and acquisition and desire and practice and letting go was just to bring you back into this moment, right now.

There is nothing else to learn. Nothing more to know.

> Read the essay called "School: The Sacred Cow" on pages 52-58 of the copy. It is worth it.

Illich speaks of the need to be awakened by surprise.  
In the Kernel syllabus, a link is drawn to the notion of information as a measure of unexpectedness in Shannon's [Information Theory](https://youtu.be/tPcCElmAaRI).

## Serenity

This chapter is based on the [Ethereum 2.0 Design Rationale](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/rkhCgQteN?type=view).

Two main reasons for including this stuff in the Kernel syllabus:

- Exploration of low-level primitives yields possibility: While we need to look at the primitives, the intention is to walk away with a better understanding of the possibilities they imply.
- It was mentioned previously that the best way to protect free speech is to price it correctly: defining what is "bad" and making it too expensive to consider. Ethereum 2.0 extends this idea greatly.

Vitalik begins the Ethereum 2.0 Design Rationale with a series of core principles:

- **Simplicity**: This (i) minimizes development costs, (ii) reduces the risk of unforeseen issues, and (iii) helps protocol designers convince users of their design.
- **Long-term stability**: The lower levels of the protocol should be built so that there is no need to change them for a decade or longer.
- **Sufficiency**: It should be possible to build any class of applications on top of the protocol.
- **Defense in depth**: The protocol should work well under a variety of security assumptions.
- **Verifiability**: A client should be able to gain assurance that the full system is available and valid, even under a 51% attack.

*Proof of Work* security and miner's incentives come from (the risk of losing) block rewards. It operates on a logic of massive power incentivized by massive rewards. This is effective, but inefficient. The cost of attack and cost of defense are 1:1, so there is no defender's advantage.

*Proof of Stake* breaks this symmetry - and disincentivizes lazy validators - by relying not on rewards for security, but on penalties. 

Ensuring that anyone, even with entry-level hardware and a small amount of ETH, can act as a validator, reduces conflict as it means that users and validators are more likely to be the same people.

The consensus algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0, *Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget*, operates not just under the "honest majority" model of 51% chains, but also the uncoordinated rational majority and worst-case models.

We need to distinguish between different types of validator failure. Most are benign (like simply being offline), few are genuinely malicious. 

Validators must attest to what they believe to be the head of the chain in each epoch (~ every 6.5 minutes). Compliant validators receive a base reward, B, multiplied with P, the portion of validators that agree. Validators that don't are penalized with âˆ’B. 

The incentives ensure that, as more validators go offline, creating a risk of blocks being prevented from being finalized, the penalty is greater. 

If a validator is caught blatantly violating the rules, they get penalized in proportion to the portion of validators that were penalized around the same time. This makes sense because coordinated attacks are more dangerous and should be punished harder than isolated failures. It also incentivizes decentralization where everyone does not join one large validator pool.
