## Censorship resistance

[Vitalik on The Problem of Censorship](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/06/the-problem-of-censorship)

Freedom of speech does not imply an ability to communicate *effectively*.  
But **blockchains fuse money (action) and speech (expression)**, and by cultivating a **listening society**, we can substantiate our freedom to speak even further.

Power structures influence what truths can be thought. **Programmable incentives** may help free us from this constraint. 

When the incentives which define the structure of power can be programmed by anyone, censorship resistance becomes an engineering problem, not an ideological one.

"Don't fight the system. Just abandon it."

Goal: Building clear and complete **threat models** which allow us to understand all possible benefits for potential censors.

Instead of using legal code to uphold free speech, we can use economic code to make censorship prohibitively expensive.  
Even if you have the economic-computational power to revert history, any economic gain is eclipsed by the loss of trust (=value) in the network.

Censorship can be more insidious than overt reversions of history though. 

**Proof of Work**: If you censor a block, you can take its transactions and its block reward for yourself.

Ethereum already provides means of making censorship costly outside the actual consensus mechanism.  
For instance, denial of service attacks are prevented by assigning a "gas" cost to each operation and limiting the amount of gas per block. 

Ethereum 2.0 aims at higher fault tolerance and stronger censorship resistance through more complete threat models and cost analysis.  

**Proof of stake**: Employs game theory along with cryptography to prove that censorship is asymmetrically expensive for the perpetrator.

We'll be using value created on a public network to secure that same network.  
This kind of economic feedback loop will lay the foundation for digital gardens where time flows differently.
