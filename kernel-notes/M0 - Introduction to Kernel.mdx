## The Play of Pattern 

Recognize patterns and ask better questions.

Example: **Complementary opposites** (quantum thought, 0 AND 1 AND everything in between).

Humility + perspective > effective decisions, good trade-offs, Middle Way.

> *What would be the complementary opposite of humility?*
>
> *What are examples from your own life to show that they can’t exist without each other?*

If you want to change the world, the world will inevitably act back and change you.

What is the question to which you are the universe's answer?  
How can you respond most honestly, accurately, and lovingly?

## Trust

Trust begins where verification ends. Trust is not blind faith.

Bitcoin maxim: **Don't trust, verify.**

Strength in numbers: A network of peers supports eg. bitcoin through maths and deterministic computation.

We can build protocols with strong trust guarantees by defining and encoding what it means to lie.

Verifiable truth > consensus > value

> *Trusting a friend’s good intentions =!= trusting that he makes no mistakes and never does bad things.*
>
> *Trust in friends and strangers is not the same.*
>
> *Isn’t a society with no need for trust as bad as one with no need for personal favors?*

To dream up important ideas, think like an idealist.  
To build systems that live up to those dreams, think like an adversary.

Access, transparency & education!

Game theory: We are each others' environment. Foster trust.

## Money Talks

[A. Antonopoulos on p2p money history](https://youtu.be/n-EpKQ6xIJs)

Money: A technology. Ancient language to communicate value.  
2009 (~ Bitcoin) saw a shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols.  
What matters now is the precedents we set.

Communicating value informs social bonds. Money is an important social tool.

**Money history:** 

&emsp;Exchange of food >  
&emsp;Symbolic payment in shells, beads etc. >  
&emsp;Precious metals >  
&emsp;Paper money (gold in the bank) >  
&emsp;Plastic cards >  
&emsp;Crypto

Also:

&emsp;Closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions >  
&emsp;Platforms >  
&emsp;Interfaces, APIs >  
&emsp;Protocols (p2p, just use the language)

Bitcoin: It’s your money; no-one can censor, seize, or freeze it. No-one can tell you what to ‘say’. You can opt in or out.

Intrinsic value > **intrinsic utility**.  
Money for the internet > internet of money.

Etherium: New expressive power: Can be traded AND programmed to do stuff.

The nature of the game - what money is, how it is created, and who gets to distribute it - goes to the heart of how we are all incentivised to act.

**Incentives**: Social/political/neurobiological primitives that influence our behaviours - individually and collectively

Programming incentives in a network-centric manner (meaning through consensus) may broaden the horizons of human consciousness. 

> How?

Bonus: If blockchain-technology persists, we could have for the first time an **immutable, shared, everlasting historical record.**

> How extraordinary that I can give A my homegrown apples in return for a token which I may give B in exchange for a massage… 
> 
> A got apples, I got a massage and B got - paper? 
> 
> That is trust!

> Intrinsic value is individual! 
>
> With abstract money the value depends on concensus: Prices depend on supply and demand; not on my hunger. 
> 
> Gold’s value lies not in how I can use the metal, but in what I can trade it for. No intrinsic value of money in the bank.

## The Art of Conversation

[Conversations with Paul Myburgh](https://youtu.be/CCYw0QVoB_U)

Aspiration: Positive sum, **horizontal conversations**, ie. interactive dialogue among peers.  
Participants share trust. Conversations continue and can be picked up later. More meaning is shared.  
**True voice.** Deep listening and good questions. Pauses to think.

Contrast: Vertical conversations where each person speaks to get their point in — not building upon each other.  
Competition. Thinking of what to say, not listening.

It's become the fashion to drop cute one-liners at each other and think that we know things.  
We ask questions without wanting the answer - we're seeking a quick-fix; a conceptual solution to a curiosity that doesn't really matter.

No-one is listening, so no-one cares what they say.  
The quality of listening informs the quality of speaking.

**Fundamentally related vs. incidentally bound.**

The task of the modern human being is to clearly and definitively seek and find knowledge.  
Not quick ideas, but actual knowledge of things. Hard yards. Every human soul taking every single step.

## With Purpose and Love 

[Van Gogh. Letter to his brother.](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/)

“Improvement in my life — should I not desire it or should I not be in need of improvement?  
I really want to improve. But it’s precisely because I yearn for it that I’m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease."

“Such a person doesn’t always know himself what he could do, but he feels by instinct, I’m good for something, even so!  
I feel I have a raison d’être! I know that I could be a quite different man!  
For what then could I be of use, for what could I serve!  
There’s something within me, so what is it!"

“But what’s your ultimate goal, you’ll say.  
The goal will become clearer, will take shape slowly and surely, as the croquis becomes a sketch and the sketch a painting”.

Do you trust the **inner voice**?

“I’m always inclined to believe that **the best way of knowing is to love a great deal.**  
But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more."
